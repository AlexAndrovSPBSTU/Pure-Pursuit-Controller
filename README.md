## Introduction
This repository is a Processing implementation of the Adaptive Pure Pursuit algorithm used to control FRC robots.

## Resources
* [A Feedforward Control Approach to the Local Navigation Problem for Autonomous Vehicles](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub1/kelly_alonzo_1994_4/kelly_alonzo_1994_4.pdf) - the main resource used in building this project.
* [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/) - the graphic library used in the project.
* [254's 2017 code](https://github.com/Team254/FRC-2017-Public) - their commented code has has been a great resource and provided a lot of good pointers for various quirks in implementation of the algorithm.
